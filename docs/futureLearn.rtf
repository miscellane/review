\b 2.16 How do we design good experiments?\par
\b0\par
While we may have access to lots of existing data, it does not necessarily mean that it will answer the questions we want to ask.\par
\par
Sometimes we will need to go out and collect more data. This can be expensive and time-consuming. This is why it\rquote s important to make sure you have the right experimental design in place before you get started; to make sure you collect the right data and enough of it to answer your questions and avoid some of the possible problems outlined in previous steps.\par
\par
There are some key stages in the experiment design process:\par
\par
\pard{\pntext\f1\'B7\tab}{\*\pn\pnlvlblt\pnf1\pnindent0{\pntxtb\'B7}}\fi-360\li720\sl240\slmult1 Have one or more clear and explicit hypotheses generated from a good understanding of the problem. This will help enormously in scoping your design and in turning stakeholders\rquote  questions into testable experiments.\par
\pard\sl240\slmult1\par
\pard{\pntext\f1\'B7\tab}{\*\pn\pnlvlblt\pnf1\pnindent0{\pntxtb\'B7}}\fi-360\li720\sl240\slmult1 Think about what you are comparing. This is often to assess the effect of a proposed decision or improvement, so, for example, the baseline or current situation may be compared with the improvement. Additionally, consider what else might affect the comparison. Could, for example, the time and place the data is collected or the people in two groups you are comparing differ in important ways? You will need to factor this in.\par
\pard\sl240\slmult1\par
\pard{\pntext\f1\'B7\tab}{\*\pn\pnlvlblt\pnf1\pnindent0{\pntxtb\'B7}}\fi-360\li720\sl240\slmult1 Think about the best way to collect the data you need. This may be available from enterprise analytics systems or you may need to conduct a survey or design a customised interface to collect it.\par
\pard\sl240\slmult1\par
\pard{\pntext\f1\'B7\tab}{\*\pn\pnlvlblt\pnf1\pnindent0{\pntxtb\'B7}}\fi-360\li720\sl240\slmult1 Ensure that your sampling \endash  the data you do collect \endash  is representative of the groups you want to say something about.\par
\pard\sl240\slmult1\par
\pard{\pntext\f1\'B7\tab}{\*\pn\pnlvlblt\pnf1\pnindent0{\pntxtb\'B7}}\fi-360\li720\sl240\slmult1 Think about how much data you will need to be in a position to differentiate any effect from randomness/chance. For example, if a coin flip gives us heads five times in a row, does it mean the coin is biased or is this just normal randomness?\par
\pard\sl240\slmult1\par
A note on randomness. Randomness is really interesting. In practice, it often behaves in unexpected ways and probably explains a lot of findings that we mistake to be due to our own action or skill. As humans, we have evolved with senses that are tuned to recognising patterns quickly (for example, seeing a poisonous snake in the grass), but this means that we also can be fooled into seeing patterns that are not there (in other words, it\rquote s just a random patch of grass that looks a bit like a snake).\par

\b 2.18 Bias and error in data collection\par
\b0\par
In a statistical sense, bias at the collection stage means that the data you have gathered is not representative of the group or activity you want to say something about.\par
\par
Shortcuts and mistakes of various kinds are part of what makes us human. As the author and psychologist Daniel Levitin (2016) says:\par
\par
Remember, people gather statistics. People choose what to count, and how to go about counting. There are a host of errors and biases that can enter into the collection process and these can lead millions of people to draw the wrong conclusions.\par
\par
Bias and error may be unintentional, but sometimes we know it has happened and ignored for the sake of an easier life.\par
\par
Some common biases or error sources to look out for in your own and others\rquote  work include:\par
\par
\b Sampling\par
\b0\par
An unbiased sampling method should mean that an individual data item within a whole set of items, a list of potential participants in an experiment, for example, could be included. This is why researchers often try to randomise the sampling process or sample randomly from a set of pre-defined groups. If there is some aspect that limits this, you are risking bias.\par
\par
For instance, if we decide to base a study of citizen digital skills on the results of an internet survey, we\rquote re excluding people without internet access, who may be significantly lower in their digital skills level. Therefore, our data is not representative.\par
\par
\b Measuring and calculating\par
\b0\par
Data collected from instruments or digital systems may be prone to error if, for example, a sensor is broken or a log file is corrupted. Often people will incorporate a sense-check that picks up anomalies like these.\par
\par
Similarly, it is easy for the researcher themself to make a simple error in calculation, especially when complex code is used to determine results. This is where open source and open data can help in letting other people reproduce the calculations to check them.\par
\par
\b Participation/responding\par
\b0\par
In an opinion survey, you may be more likely to get participation from those people who have a strong feeling about the subject one way or another. Whereas those who are less opinionated may be less likely to respond. One way to avoid this is to advertise it with a more general theme. For example, you might say your survey is about shopping in general rather than views on Marmite.\par
\par
\b Reporting accuracy\par
\b0\par
People may tell you something about their own behaviour that is different to the way they behave in practice. This is why it is sometimes good to combine spoken reports with behavioural data.\par
\par
It\rquote s important for a data scientist to sharpen their understanding of statistical evidence and the claims or decisions that it may or may not support.\par
\par
\b To sharpen your own understanding\b0 , we recommend you practise spotting biases and errors in your daily life \endash  as you read newspapers, social media and research studies.\par
\par
Going forward, you will gain confidence in designing your own analyses and applying appropriate statistical tests. You\rquote ll also become adept at explaining what the results imply and understanding their limitations or the potential sources of bias that might have been introduced during data collection.\par
\par
\par
\b Your task\par
\b0\par
Have a look at the report Bouncing Back: Consumer Views on Traveling ({\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://flywire.foleon.com/report/bouncing-back-consumer-views-on-traveling-again/cover/"}}{\fldrslt{\ul\cf1 https://flywire.foleon.com/report/bouncing-back-consumer-views-on-traveling-again/cover/}}}\f0\fs22 ) Again which reports on a survey looking at people\rquote s intentions to fly again post-COVID-19.\par
\par
If the report is about all potential consumers, what bias might there be from their sampling strategy?\par
\par
Think about some of the possible issues with bias and error and how the survey could have been presented to the respondents. Share your ideas with your fellow learners in the comments area.\par
