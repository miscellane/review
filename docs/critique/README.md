## A Research Paper Critique

<br>

[Nutrition-related health effects of organic foods](https://doi.org/10.3945/ajcn.2010.29269)

The authors concluded that “... a systematic review of the currently available published literature, evidence is lacking for nutrition-related 
health effects that result from the consumption of organically produced foodstuffs”.

<br>

### Interpretation:

Alas, by virtue of the study design – which omitted substances that should be studied in relation to nutritional effects of 
organic/conventional foods - the authors' didn't investigate their question.  [Nutrition or nutrition science is focused on how … “nutrients 
and compounds in foods nourish and affect body functions and health”]

Apart from not investigating their question, the authors based their conclusion on [1] an observational study … “inferences to populations can be 
drawn from random sampling studies, but not otherwise” from the Statistical Sleuth, [2] t-tests, albeit the values that underpin the test statistics 
do not form a normal distribution (ref. long report), hence the t-tests are inappropriate (https://www.statology.org/t-test-assumptions/), [3] a 
design that did not explicitly account consider confounding factors, [4] etc. [By the way, for each nutrient or compound … it seems the test statistic 
was the average of the percentage difference between the nutrient content of an organic item and a conventional counterpart]

<br>
<br>

### Alternate explanations:

Perhaps the most damning & puzzling aspect of the study is this statement by the authors … “this review does not address contaminant content 
(such as herbicide, pesticide and fungicide residues) of organically and conventionally produced foodstuffs”

As noted above, nutrition or nutrition science is about how … nutrients and compounds in foods nourish and affect body functions and 
health.  The/a key rationale for preferring organic foods is the absence, or minimised amounts of, toxic substances that may limit 
nourishing effects or detrimentally affect body functions and health.

Additionally, and considering the analysis in books such as Silent Spring, the beneficial & non-beneficial effects of conventional foods grown 
with the aid of herbicides, pesticides, fertilisers, etc., are better understood in terms of how their chemicals interact with naturally occurring 
chemicals in the food or in our body.  Depending on the environment a chemical might be harmless or interact with other chemicals to produce one or 
more toxic compounds, which immediately or progressively kill or cause a series of health problems.

In a nutshell, the research paradigm is questionable.

[The review does not address the environmental impacts of organic and conventional agricultural practices.]

### Replication

No replications, but a similar European Union funded study, that was referred to at the time, led to opposite conclusions.  The study in 
question is probably the focus of the journal paper -- Higher antioxidant and lower cadmium concentrations and lower incidence of pesticide 
residues in organically grown crops: a systematic literature review and meta-analyses, https://doi.org/10.1017/S0007114514001366 .

<br>

### Independence

Unclear.  The journal notes that “None of the authors declared a conflict of interest”, but a proactive check for 
independence or no-conflict-of-interest isn't clear.
